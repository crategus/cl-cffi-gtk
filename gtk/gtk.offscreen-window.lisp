  @begin{short}
    @sym{gtk-offscreen-window} is strictly intended to be used for obtaining
    snapshots of widgets that are not part of a normal widget hierarchy.
  @end{short}
  Since @sym{gtk-offscreen-window} is a toplevel widget you cannot obtain
  snapshots of a full window with it since you cannot pack a toplevel widget in
  another toplevel.

  The idea is to take a widget and manually set the state of it, add it to a
  @sym{gtk-offscreen-window} and then retrieve the snapshot as a
  @symbol{cairo-surface-t} or @class{gdk-pixbuf} object.

  @sym{gtk-offscreen-window} derives from @class{gtk-window} only as an
  implementation detail. Applications should not use any API specific to
  @class{gtk-window} to operate on this object. It should be treated as a
  @class{gtk-bin} that has no parent widget.

  When contained offscreen widgets are redrawn, @sym{gtk-offscreen-window} will
  emit a \"damage-event\" signal.
