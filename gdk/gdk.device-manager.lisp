 "@version{2013-6-18}
  @begin{short}
    In addition to a single pointer and keyboard for user interface input, GDK
    contains support for a variety of input devices, including graphics tablets,
    touchscreens and multiple pointers/keyboards interacting simultaneously with
    the user interface. Such input devices often have additional features, such
    as sub-pixel positioning information and additional device-dependent
    information.

    In order to query the device hierarchy and be aware of changes in the device
    hierarchy (such as virtual devices being created or removed, or physical
    devices being plugged or unplugged), GDK provides @sym{gdk-device-manager}.
  @end{short}

  By default, and if the platform supports it, GDK is aware of multiple
  keyboard/pointer pairs and multitouch devices. This behavior can be changed
  by calling the function @fun{gdk-disable-multidevice} before the function
  @fun{gdk-display-open}. There should rarely be a need to do that though, since
  GDK defaults to a compatibility mode in which it will emit just one
  enter/leave event pair for all devices on a window. To enable per-device
  enter/leave events and other multi-pointer interaction features, the function
  @fun{gdk-window-set-support-multidevice} must be called on @class{gdk-window}
  objects (or the function @fun{gtk-widget-set-support-multidevice} on widgets).
  See the @fun{gdk-window-set-support-multidevice} documentation for more
  information.

  On X11, multi-device support is implemented through XInput 2. Unless the
  function @fun{gdk-disable-multidevice} is called, the XInput 2
  @sym{gdk-device-manager} implementation will be used as the input source.
  Otherwise either the core or XInput 1 implementations will be used.

  For simple applications that do not have any special interest in input
  devices, the so-called client pointer provides a reasonable approximation to
  a simple setup with a single pointer and keyboard. The device that has been
  set as the client pointer can be accessed via the function
  @fun{gdk-device-manager-get-client-pointer}.

  Conceptually, in multidevice mode there are 2 device types. Virtual devices
  (or master devices) are represented by the pointer cursors and keyboard foci
  that are seen on the screen. Physical devices (or slave devices) represent
  the hardware that is controlling the virtual devices, and thus have no
  visible cursor on the screen.

  Virtual devices are always paired, so there is a keyboard device for every
  pointer device. Associations between devices may be inspected through the
  function @fun{gdk-device-get-associated-device}.

  There may be several virtual devices, and several physical devices could be
  controlling each of these virtual devices. Physical devices may also be
  \"floating\", which means they are not attached to any virtual device.

  @b{Example:} Master and slave devices

  @end{pre}
  By default, GDK will automatically listen for events coming from all master
  devices, setting the @class{gdk-device} object for all events coming from
  input devices. Events containing device information are @code{:motion-notify},
  @code{:button-press}, @code{:2button-press}, @code{:3button-press},
  @code{:button-release}, @code{:scroll}, @code{:key-press},
  @code{:key-release}, @code{:enter-notify}, @code{:leave-notify},
  @code{:focus-change}, @code{:proximity-in}, @code{:proximity-out},
  @code{:drag-enter}, @code{:drag-leave}, @code{:drag-motion},
  @code{:drag-status}, @code{:drop-start}, @code{:drop-finished} and
  @code{:grab-broken}. When dealing with an event on a master device, it is
  possible to get the source (slave) device that the event originated from via
  the function @fun{gdk-event-get-source-device}.

  In order to listen for events coming from devices other than a virtual
  device, the function @fun{gdk-window-set-device-events} must be called.
  Generally, this function can be used to modify the event mask for any given
  device.

  Input devices may also provide additional information besides x/y. For
  example, graphics tablets may also provide pressure and x/y tilt
  information. This information is device-dependent, and may be queried
  through the function @fun{gdk-device-get-axis}. In multidevice mode, virtual
  devices will change axes in order to always represent the physical device that
  is routing events through it. Whenever the physical device changes, the
  \"n-axes\" property will be notified, and the function
  @fun{gdk-device-list-axes} will return the new device axes.

  Devices may also have associated keys or macro buttons. Such keys can be
  globally set to map into normal X keyboard events. The mapping is set using
  the function @fun{gdk-device-set-key}.
  @begin[Signal Details]{dictionary}
    @subheading{The \"device-added\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
 lambda (device-manager device)   : Run Last
      @end{pre}
      The \"device-added\" signal is emitted either when a new master pointer
      is created, or when a slave (Hardware) input device is plugged in.
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[device-manager]{The object on which the signal is emitted.}
        @entry[device]{The newly added @class{gdk-device} object.}

    @subheading{The \"device-changed\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
 lambda (device-manager device)   : Run Last
      @end{pre}
      The \"device-changed\" signal is emitted whenever a device has changed in
      the hierarchy, either slave devices being disconnected from their master
      device or connected to another one, or master devices being added or
      removed a slave device.
      If a slave device is detached from all master devices (the function
      @fun{gdk-device-get-associated-device} returns @code{nil}), its
      @symbol{gdk-device-type} will change to @code{:floating}, if it is
      attached, it will change to @code{:slave}.
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[device-manager]{The object on which the signal is emitted.}
        @entry[device]{The @class{gdk-device} object that changed.}

    @subheading{The \"device-removed\" signal}
      @begin{pre}
 lambda (device-manager device)   : Run Last
      @end{pre}
      The \"device-removed\" signal is emitted either when a master pointer is
      removed, or when a slave (Hardware) input device is unplugged.
      @begin[code]{table}
        @entry[device-manager]{The object on which the signal is emitted.}

  This call must happen prior to the functions @fun{gdk-display-open},
  @code{gtk_init()}, @code{gtk_init_with_args()} or @code{gtk_init_check()} in
  order to take effect.

  Most common GTK+ applications will not ever need to call this. Only
  applications that do mixed GDK/Xlib calls could want to disable multidevice
  support if such Xlib code deals with input devices in any way and does not
  observe the presence of XInput 2.
