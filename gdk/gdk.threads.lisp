;;; Description
;;;
;;; For thread safety, GDK relies on the thread primitives in GLib, and on the
;;; thread-safe GLib main loop.
;;;
;;; GLib is completely thread safe (all global data is automatically locked),
;;; but individual data structure instances are not automatically locked for
;;; performance reasons. So e.g. you must coordinate accesses to the same
;;; GHashTable from multiple threads.
;;;
;;; GTK+ is "thread aware" but not thread safe â€” it provides a global lock
;;; controlled by gdk_threads_enter()/gdk_threads_leave() which protects all use
;;; of GTK+. That is, only one thread can use GTK+ at any given time.
;;;
;;; Unfortunately the above holds with the X11 backend only. With the Win32
;;; backend, GDK calls should not be attempted from multiple threads at all.
;;;
;;; You must call gdk_threads_init() before executing any other GTK+ or GDK
;;; functions in a threaded GTK+ program.
;;;
;;; Idles, timeouts, and input functions from GLib, such as g_idle_add(), are
;;; executed outside of the main GTK+ lock. So, if you need to call GTK+ inside
;;; of such a callback, you must surround the callback with a
;;; gdk_threads_enter()/gdk_threads_leave() pair or use
;;; gdk_threads_add_idle_full() which does this for you. However, event
;;; dispatching from the mainloop is still executed within the main GTK+ lock,
;;; so callback functions connected to event signals like "button-press-event",
;;; do not need thread protection.
;;;
;;; In particular, this means, if you are writing widgets that might be used in
;;; threaded programs, you must surround timeouts and idle functions in this
;;; matter.
;;;
;;; As always, you must also surround any calls to GTK+ not made within a signal
;;; handler with a gdk_threads_enter()/gdk_threads_leave() pair.
;;;
;;; Before calling gdk_threads_leave() from a thread other than your main
;;; thread, you probably want to call gdk_flush() to send all pending commands
;;; to the windowing system. (The reason you don't need to do this from the main
;;; thread is that GDK always automatically flushes pending commands when it
;;; runs out of incoming events to process and has to sleep while waiting for
;;; more events.)
;;;
;;; A minimal main program for a threaded GTK+ application looks like:
;;;
;;;   int
;;;   main (int argc, char *argv[])
;;;   {
;;;     GtkWidget *window;
;;;
;;;     gdk_threads_init ();
;;;     gdk_threads_enter ();
;;;
;;;     gtk_init (&argc, &argv);
;;;
;;;     window = create_window ();
;;;     gtk_widget_show (window);
;;;
;;;     gtk_main ();
;;;     gdk_threads_leave ();
;;;
;;;     return 0;
;;;   }
;;;
;;; Callbacks require a bit of attention. Callbacks from GTK+ signals are made
;;; within the GTK+ lock. However callbacks from GLib (timeouts, IO callbacks,
;;; and idle functions) are made outside of the GTK+ lock. So, within a signal
;;; handler you do not need to call gdk_threads_enter(), but within the other
;;; types of callbacks, you do.
;;;
;;; Erik Mouw contributed the following code example to illustrate how to use
;;; threads within GTK+ programs.

;;;
;;; For these reason, the threading support has been deprecated in GTK+ 3.6.
;;; Instead of calling GTK+ directly from multiple threads, it is recommended to
;;; use g_idle_add(), g_main_context_invoke() and similar functions to make
;;; these calls from the main thread instead. The main thread is the thread
;;; which has called gtk_init() and is running the GTK+ mainloop. GTK+ itself
;;; will continue to use the GDK lock internally as long as the deprecated
;;; functionality is still available, and other libraries should probably do
;;; the same.

  Note that timeout functions may be delayed, due to the processing of other
