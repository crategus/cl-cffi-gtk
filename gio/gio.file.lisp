;;;
;;; Prerequisites
;;;
;;; GFile requires GObject.
;;;
;;; Description
;;;
;;; GFile is a high level abstraction for manipulating files on a virtual file
;;; system. GFiles are lightweight, immutable objects that do no I/O upon
;;; creation. It is necessary to understand that GFile objects do not represent
;;; files, merely an identifier for a file. All file content I/O is implemented
;;; as streaming operations (see GInputStream and GOutputStream).
;;;
;;; To construct a GFile, you can use: g_file_new_for_path() if you have a path.
;;; g_file_new_for_uri() if you have a URI. g_file_new_for_commandline_arg() for
;;; a command line argument. g_file_new_tmp() to create a temporary file from a
;;; template. g_file_parse_name() from a utf8 string gotten from
;;; g_file_get_parse_name().
;;;
;;; One way to think of a GFile is as an abstraction of a pathname. For normal
;;; files the system pathname is what is stored internally, but as GFiles are
;;; extensible it could also be something else that corresponds to a pathname in
;;; a userspace implementation of a filesystem.
;;;
;;; GFiles make up hierarchies of directories and files that correspond to the
;;; files on a filesystem. You can move through the file system with GFile using
;;; g_file_get_parent() to get an identifier for the parent directory,
;;; g_file_get_child() to get a child within a directory,
;;; g_file_resolve_relative_path() to resolve a relative path between two
;;; GFiles. There can be multiple hierarchies, so you may not end up at the same
;;; root if you repeatedly call g_file_get_parent() on two different files.
;;;
;;; All GFiles have a basename (get with g_file_get_basename()). These names are
;;; byte strings that are used to identify the file on the filesystem (relative
;;; to its parent directory) and there is no guarantees that they have any
;;; particular charset encoding or even make any sense at all. If you want to
;;; use filenames in a user interface you should use the display name that you
;;; can get by requesting the G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_STANDARD_DISPLAY_NAME attribute
;;; with g_file_query_info(). This is guaranteed to be in utf8 and can be used
;;; in a user interface. But always store the real basename or the GFile to use
;;; to actually access the file, because there is no way to go from a display
;;; name to the actual name.
;;;
;;; Using GFile as an identifier has the same weaknesses as using a path in that
;;; there may be multiple aliases for the same file. For instance, hard or soft
;;; links may cause two different GFiles to refer to the same file. Other
;;; possible causes for aliases are: case insensitive filesystems, short and
;;; long names on Fat/NTFS, or bind mounts in Linux. If you want to check if two
;;; GFiles point to the same file you can query for the G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ID_FILE
;;; attribute. Note that GFile does some trivial canonicalization of pathnames
;;; passed in, so that trivial differences in the path string used at creation
;;; (duplicated slashes, slash at end of path, "." or ".." path segments, etc)
;;; does not create different GFiles.
;;;
;;; Many GFile operations have both synchronous and asynchronous versions to
;;; suit your application. Asynchronous versions of synchronous functions simply
;;; have _async() appended to their function names. The asynchronous I/O
;;; functions call a GAsyncReadyCallback which is then used to finalize the
;;; operation, producing a GAsyncResult which is then passed to the function's
;;; matching _finish() operation.
;;;
;;; Some GFile operations do not have synchronous analogs, as they may take a
;;; very long time to finish, and blocking may leave an application unusable.
;;; Notable cases include: g_file_mount_mountable() to mount a mountable file.
;;; g_file_unmount_mountable_with_operation() to unmount a mountable file.
;;; g_file_eject_mountable_with_operation() to eject a mountable file.
;;;
;;; One notable feature of GFiles are entity tags, or "etags" for short. Entity
;;; tags are somewhat like a more abstract version of the traditional mtime, and
;;; can be used to quickly determine if the file has been modified from the
;;; version on the file system. See the HTTP 1.1 specification for HTTP Etag
;;; headers, which are a very similar concept.

;;; Utility function to check if a particular file exists. This is implemented using g_file_query_info() and as such does blocking I/O.
;;;
;;; Note that in many cases it is racy to first check for file existence and then execute something based on the outcome of that, because the file might have been created or removed in between the operations. The general approach to handling that is to not check, but just do the operation and handle the errors as they come.
;;;
;;; As an example of race-free checking, take the case of reading a file, and if it doesn't exist, creating it. There are two racy versions: read it, and on error create it; and: check if it exists, if not create it. These can both result in two processes creating the file (with perhaps a partially written file as the result). The correct approach is to always try to create the file with g_file_create() which will either atomically create the file or fail with a G_IO_ERROR_EXISTS error.
;;;
;;; However, in many cases an existence check is useful in a user interface, for instance to make a menu item sensitive/insensitive, so that you don't have to fool users that something is possible and then just show and error dialog. If you do this, you should make sure to also handle the errors that can happen due to races when you execute the operation.

;;; Similar to g_file_query_info(), but obtains information about the filesystem the file is on, rather than the file itself. For instance the amount of space available and the type of the filesystem.
;;;
;;; The attributes value is a string that specifies the file attributes that should be gathered. It is not an error if it's not possible to read a particular requested attribute from a file - it just won't be set. attributes should be a comma-separated list of attributes or attribute wildcards. The wildcard "*" means all attributes, and a wildcard like "filesystem::*" means all attributes in the filesystem namespace. The standard namespace for filesystem attributes is "filesystem". Common attributes of interest are G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_FILESYSTEM_SIZE (the total size of the filesystem in bytes), G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_FILESYSTEM_FREE (number of bytes available), and G_FILE_ATTRIBUTE_FILESYSTEM_TYPE (type of the filesystem).
